## Project Overview

This project serves as a basic introduction to state management using React hooks. The core concept of this project is the management and manipulation of a simple count value through various operations (increment, decrement, and reset).

This project uses React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. This allows for the creation of reusable, component-based UI elements, ultimately leading to efficient and modular code.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/thisisyoussef/counter-assignment.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd counter-assignment
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

After executing these steps, the application should be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage Guide

Once the development server is up and running, you should see the Counter Assignment application in your web browser. The application displays the current count value and three buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the count.

To update the count value, simply click on the appropriate button (Increment, Decrement, or Reset) and watch as the count value updates accordingly.

## Features and Functionality

The Counter Assignment project provides the following features:

- Increment Count: This button will increase the count value by 1.
- Decrement Count: This button will decrease the count value by 1, down to a minimum of 0.
- Reset Count: This button will reset the count value to 0.

The user interface is kept simple and minimal to focus on the core functionality and state management aspect of the project.
